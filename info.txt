This project relies heavily on documentation from P.JBoy's website: https://patrickjohnston.org/bank/index.html
If you're here to read, rather than edit, you're better off viewing from the website (it has more comments)
Many of the comments found in this disassembly are copied (with permission) from PJ's bank logs, RAM map, and other documents; often verbatim.


Assembly style:
Labels appear on their own lines
Assembler directives are not indented
Code/data that is written to the ROM is indented using 4 spaces
Sublabels are indented using 2 spaces
Anonymous labels are not indented, and appear inline with code
Hardware registers are not labeled, at least not unless we create better labels than traditional ones


The address column on the right will be removed once all labels are accounted for
